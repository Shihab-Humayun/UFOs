# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Additional filters that have been added are city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To perform a search the user will have to enter information under the Filter Search section of the page. For example, the image below shows the results after entering "1/11/2010" and "fl". This shows all the sightings in Florida on that specific date. To reset the filter, the user can click on the top left of the page where it says "UFO Sightings".

## Summary

One drawback to this webpage is that there is no quick way of clearing the filters. The user currently has to go to the top left of the page and click on the text to reset the filter. A suggestion that can help improve the page is to create a "clear filter" button, to allow users to quickly clear the filter. Another suggestion for further development to make the webpage better is to create multiple inputs in one given label. For example, if a user wanted to look at UFO sightings in the state of "fl" and "ca", then they would be able to. Currently it is only able to take one criteria for each label.
