# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of the UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Additional filters that have been added are city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To perform a search the user will have to enter information under the Filter Search section of the page. For example, the image below shows the results after entering "1/11/2010" and "fl". This shows all the sightings in Florida on that specific date. To reset the filter, the user can click on the top left of the page where it says "UFO Sightings".
